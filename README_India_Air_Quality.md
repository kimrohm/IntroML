# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis - India Air Pollution


# Project Description

This project analyzes air quality, measuring levels of various pollutants in India by state for the years 1990 - 2015. Using this data by state, we calculated and identified the trending impact on air quality from these pollutants, which is compared across states and includes a focus on Andhra Pradesh.

## Steps

1. Cleaning the Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Interpreting the Results
